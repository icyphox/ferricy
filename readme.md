# ferricy
> A 34-key split keyboard based on the [Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep/).

Ferricy is a slightly modified version of the Ferris Sweep, sporting a
more industrial look with sharper edges. Notable features:

- Ferricy MX based on the Sweep MX Bling.
- Ferricy Choc based on the Sweep Half-Swept.
- Tenting puck support has been removed (I have no use for it).
- Squared-off edges (plates modified accordingly).
- Larger holes in the PCB for M2 standoffs to pass through.
- The stupid Rust crab is gone.

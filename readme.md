# ferricy
> A 34-key split keyboard based on the [Sweep Bling MX](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep/tree/main/Sweep%20Bling%20MX).

Ferricy is a slightly modified version of the Ferris Sweep Bling MX,
sporting a more industrial look with sharper edges. Notable features:

- MX only.
- Tenting puck support has been removed (I have no use for it).
- Squared-off edges (plates modified accordingly).
- Larger holes in the PCB for M2 standoffs to pass through.
- The stupid Rust crab is gone.
